# CGPA-Calculator
I created a CGPA calculator to calculate my CGPA per semester.

As a student passionate about programming and education, I developed a Python script to calculate my Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for each semester. The program takes user input for GPA and credit hours, allowing for an efficient and personalized calculation. With a user-friendly interface and a clear breakdown of grading ranges, it provides a quick overview of academic performance. This project reflects my commitment to combining programming skills with practical solutions to enhance the student experience.
